                                    <p>* Gulab Jamun is a classic Indian sweet made by combining milk powder, flour, ghee, and milk into a soft dough. Small balls are shaped and fried slowly until golden brown, ensuring a soft, spongy center. These are then soaked in warm sugar syrup flavored with cardamom and rose water, allowing them to absorb sweetness. Served warm or cold, they melt in the mouth and are a festive favorite across India.</p>
